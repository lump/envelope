Envelope

This is an envelope-based budget.  The idea is that you pre-allocate
funds into the budget, and you should only spend money in a category
if there are available funds to cover it.  All of the balances in
accounts should add up and reconcile to the current balance of the
bank account you're budgeting.

The the current state of this project is very unstable and not all 
features have been implemented.
